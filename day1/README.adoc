Problem statement: iterate a list of integers, find the 2/3 integers in the
list that sum to 2020. Multiply those integers to get the result.

Approach: I can only think of one way to find the solution - which is to add
numbers together, check if the result is 2020, and then if so, print the result
of multiplying those numbers instead. 

While it's most likely possible to reduce the search space of possible numbers
(eg, 1200 + 1300 will always > 2000), so ignore that combination, the search
space is small enough that a brute force, naive solution works; try adding all 
numbers to each other. In Part 2 of the puzzle (3 integers that add to 2020),
the search space is still only 200 numbers, so even with a **grotesque** O(3)
efficiency in worse case, this still returns in < 15 seconds (or 1 second if
you disable debug output - as most most of that time is formatting console output).
